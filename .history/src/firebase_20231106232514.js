import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";

It seems like there is an issue with your db object in the useEffect of your Feed component. The error is indicating that db.collection is not a function, which suggests that db is not an instance of Firestore.

Make sure that you are importing and initializing db correctly from your firebase module. In your firebase.js or wherever you initialize Firebase, ensure that you are importing and initializing Firestore correctly. Here's an example:

javascript
Copy code
// firebase.js

import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyByJo6BBMHfGItRF7HGj5zxbiHdhlcVcmU",
  authDomain: "linkedin-clone-31fc8.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "linkedin-clone-31fc8",
  storageBucket: "linkedin-clone-31fc8.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "198073496226",
  appId: "1:198073496226:web:0720a8e5f7132ae718ddfb",
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

export const auth = getAuth(app);
export const db = getFirestore(app);
export default app;
